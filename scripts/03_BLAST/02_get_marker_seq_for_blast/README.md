## **Files and subfolders**

The current set of input files include:
- `../../data/raw_data/RefSeq/streptomyces_genomes/GCF_000718245.1/GCF_000718245.1_ASM71824v1_genomic.gbff`: genbak file from which the allelic sequences are extracted

The current set of output subfolders include:

- `../../data/blastn_tblastn_marker_genes`: subfolder with fasta files with protein sequence for each marker
